## Who am I
Once upon a time, I was a blogger on a somewhat large site. It was a site that was full of Agile proponents (of which I was decidedly not). I was an early Web 2.0 trainer and proponent (Ok, I was a little critical of that too). Later, I left that blog and tried to start my own site. Admittedly, I was naive in thinking that it would be easy to duplicate. It was not. Also during this time, I started speaking at dev user groups (and for a time I also ran one). In some respects, I was border-line dev famous.

After a time, I moved off my site, and archived my content to my own blog, and then I got busy. Blogging became less of a thing for me. Eventually, I shut the whole thing down (well, the archive got shut down as my hosting lapsed). Now, I always have had stuff I could write about, but I just didn't have the time to do it. Anyway, fast forward to today. I have something I want to write about.

## I love Deno
Every dev, spends time in their off hours working on personal projects. Sometimes they publish those projects, and sometimes they let those projects die on their local machines. Usually they spend time with new tech, new languages, etc. For me the goto has been Deno. In my day job I am mostly a C# developer (although I am still a decent react dev as well). Admittedly, I've never been a huge proponent of NodeJs. It feels clunky. I guess I should also say that I love TypeScript! TypeScript is a first class citizen in Deno. Additionally I love the Rust backend (I also have a love of Wasm/Wasi). There's a lot to love.

## Enter Deno Deploy
I recently have been learning about Deno Deploy. This blog is an experiment with Deno Deploy, and so (at least for the moment) my blog is back.
